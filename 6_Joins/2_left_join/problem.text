🧠 LEFT JOIN Practice Problems
🟢 Problem 1 (Basic LEFT JOIN)
Display:
employee name
department name
👉 Requirement:
Show all employees, even if they don’t belong to any department.

🟢 Problem 2 (LEFT JOIN + NULL Handling)
Find all employees who do not have a valid department.
👉 Hint: You’ll need to check for NULL values from the right table.

🟢 Problem 3 (LEFT JOIN with Filtering)
List all employees and their department names, but:
Only show departments Engineering and Sales
Still show employees with no department
👉 This one tests WHERE vs ON clause behavior 👀

🟢 Problem 4 (LEFT JOIN + COUNT)
Count how many employees are in each department.
Include departments with zero employees

🟢 Problem 5 (Real-world style)
Show:
employee name
department name
hire date
Sort results by:
department name (NULLs last)
hire date (oldest first)
