/*
You are given three tables:
Students
ID: Integer, unique student ID
Name: String, student name
Friends
ID: Integer, student ID
Friend_ID: Integer, ID of the student's only best friend
Packages
ID: Integer, student ID
Salary: Decimal, salary offer received by the student (in $ thousands per month)
ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Write an SQL query to find the names of students whose best friends received a higher salary offer than they did.
Output only the names of such students.
Order the result by the salary offered to the best friend, in ascending order.
It is guaranteed that:
Every student has exactly one best friend.
No two students received the same salary.
âœ… Example Output
Given the following logic:
Samanthaâ€™s friend got $11.55K, she got $11.00K
Juliaâ€™s friend got $12.12K, she got $11.10K
Scarletâ€™s friend got $15.20K, she got $15.00K
Ashleyâ€™s friend got $14.50K, she got $15.50K
Expected Output:
Samantha
Julia
Scarlet
